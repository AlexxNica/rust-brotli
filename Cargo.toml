description = "A brotli decompressor that does not use the rust stdlib. This makes it suitable for embedded devices and kernels. It is designed with a pluggable allocator so that the standard lib's allocator may be employed. For users wishing to use the stdlib, the brotli package, which calls into and abstracts this package, is recommended."
